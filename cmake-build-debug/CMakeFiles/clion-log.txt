CMake Warning at ligero/CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsodium.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "sodium", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sodium" with any
  of the following names:

    sodiumConfig.cmake
    sodium-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sodium" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sodium_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "sodium"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
